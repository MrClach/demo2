I'm going back to 505
If it's a seven-hour flight or a 45-minute drive 
In my imagination, you're waiting lying on your side
With your hands between your ghighs

Stop and wait a sec
Oh, when you look at me like that, my darling, what did
you expect?
I'd probably still adore you with your hands around my
neck
Or I did last time I checked

Not shy of a spark
A knife twists at the thought that I should fall short of
the mark
Frightened by the bite, though it's no harsher than the 
bark
The middle of adventure is such a perfect place to stat
I'm going back to 505
If it's a seven-hour flight or a 45-minute drive
In my imagination, you're waiting lying on your side
With your hands between your thigh
